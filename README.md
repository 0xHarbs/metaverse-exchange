# Metaverse Exchange

Non practical concept for a metaverse marketplace and exchange. The contract includes:
- ERC 1155 minting
- Token offering
- Exchage Orderbook (used linkedlist approach for understanding purposes)
- ERC 1155 buyout - allows all holders to be bought out (functionality needs to be added to finalise)
- Rental agreement - list property and rent (functionality needs to be added to finalise)
